Wordle Solver
=============

A program which tries to solve [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) puzzles as efficiently as possible. Perfection would be nice but really I'd just like this thing to be able to solve it better than me.

In `scripts/` you will find a few short scripts I used to organise the data, work out which word our solver should begin with and so on.
